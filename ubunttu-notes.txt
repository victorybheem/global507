DevOps toolchain

As DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, rather than a single DevOps tool there are sets (or "toolchains") of multiple tools.[6] Such DevOps tools are expected to fit into one or more of these categories, reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process:[7][8]

    Code — code development and review, source code management tools, code merging
    Build — continuous integration tools, build status
    Test — continuous testing tools that provide feedback on business risks
    Package — artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging
    Release — change management, release approvals, release automation
    Configure — infrastructure configuration and management, Infrastructure as Code tools
    Monitor — applications performance monitoring, end–user experience
